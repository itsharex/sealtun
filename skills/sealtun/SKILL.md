# Sealtun

## First Decision

Classify the request before answering or editing:

- User operation: install, shell completion, guided init, login, discover local ports, expose HTTPS, SSH, or generic TCP, generate protocol templates, secure public HTTP traffic, create/list/revoke temporary share links, plan/add/verify a custom domain, inspect state, watch status, view resources, stop/start/resume, clean up, export YAML, or use the dashboard. Read `references/cli.md`.
- Declarative configuration: `sealtun.yaml`, `apply -f`, `diff -f`, `export`, multi-tunnel management, stable names, `ttl`, HTTPS access policies, SSH tunnel declarations, or generic TCP tunnel declarations. Read `references/declarative.md`.
- Troubleshooting: login/profile mismatch, daemon/session issues, local port discovery/failures, SSH/TCP direct NodePort problems, remote Kubernetes problems, resource lists/resource occupancy, DNS, Ingress, certificate, logs, metrics, events, dashboard live updates, or dashboard behavior. Read `references/troubleshooting.md`.
- Skill maintenance or quality review: trigger precision, workflow scoring, or regression prompts for this skill. Read `references/evals.md`.

If the request is inside the Sealtun repository, prefer the current source tree and README over these references when they conflict. Use `rg` to inspect Cobra commands and flags before changing CLI usage guidance.

## Intent Routing

Use the user's intent to choose the shortest safe path:

| User intent | Primary path | Verify with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Make a local web app, dev server, callback, preview, or webhook public | `status` -> `discover` when port is unclear -> `expose <port>` | URL from output, `list --check`, `inspect <id>` |
| Add Basic Auth, Bearer token, IP rules, or temporary links | HTTPS `expose` or YAML access policy | `inspect <id>`, protected request behavior, `metrics <id>` when relevant |
| Expose SSH directly | `expose 22 --protocol ssh` | printed SSH host/port, `inspect <id> --remote`, user SSH client output |
| Expose database, queue, MQTT, or arbitrary TCP | `template <protocol>` for guidance, then `expose <port> --protocol tcp` | printed `<host>:<node-port>`, protocol client, `list --check` |
| Manage many tunnels or stable config | edit `sealtun.yaml`, then `apply --dry-run`, `diff`, real `apply` only when requested | apply output, `list`, `inspect` |
| Custom domain | `domain plan` first; `domain add --wait` only when mutation is requested | `domain verify/status`, DNS CNAME, certificate status |
| Debug connectivity or unclear state | non-mutating checks first: `status`, `list --check`, `inspect`, `resources`, `doctor`, `logs/events/metrics` | layer-specific finding and next action |
| Watch or repair tunnel state | `watch` for status changes; `doctor --fix --dry-run` before `doctor --fix` | dry-run plan, then verified state |
| Use dashboard | local dashboard by default; remote dashboard only with `--allow-remote` and Basic Auth guidance | page opens, live badge/resources tab, command preview, token/confirm behavior |

## Required Execution Flow

Follow this flow after the skill triggers:

1. Scope gate: verify the request is about making a local/dev service publicly reachable, operating a Sealtun tunnel, troubleshooting Sealtun, or declarative Sealtun config. If it is only generic production deployment, buying a domain, DNS-only configuration, generic Kubernetes, or generic SSH without Sealtun tunneling, do not force Sealtun into the answer.
2. Select one mode before acting:
   - Guidance mode: user asks how to use Sealtun. Load the matching reference and give commands; do not run live tunnel/cloud commands.
   - Live operation mode: user explicitly asks to execute, create, apply, stop, clean up, or bind a domain. Run preflight checks first, then the requested command, then verification.
   - Troubleshooting mode: user reports a problem. Run non-mutating diagnostics first, identify the likely layer, then propose or perform fixes only when the requested action is clear.
3. Gather minimum context. Inside this repo, inspect current code/README before relying on references. Outside the repo, use the references as the command source. Prefer non-mutating checks such as `sealtun --version`, `sealtun status`, `sealtun init`, `sealtun profile current`, `sealtun region current`, `sealtun discover`, `sealtun list`, `sealtun inspect`, `sealtun resources`, and `sealtun doctor`.
4. Handle first-use authorization gently. If `status` shows no login, explain that Sealtun needs Sealos authorization and kubeconfig before creating cloud resources. Guide the user through `sealtun login`, or `sealtun login <region> --profile <name>` when region/profile matters. If a browser/device authorization flow opens, tell the user to complete it in the browser and wait; do not treat the pause as a failure. After login, verify with `sealtun status`, `sealtun region current`, and optionally `sealtun profile current`.
5. Control mutations. Do not run `sealtun expose`, real `sealtun apply`, `sealtun share create/revoke`, `sealtun domain add/set/clear`, `sealtun stop`, `sealtun cleanup`, `sealtun logout`, or dashboard write actions unless the user explicitly asked for that operation in the current task. `sealtun template`, `sealtun domain plan`, `sealtun share list`, `sealtun export`, dashboard viewing, `apply --dry-run`, `diff`, and read-only diagnostics are safe guidance steps. For declarative changes, prefer `apply --dry-run` and `diff` before real `apply`.
6. Verify completion. After live operations, use the contract below, then report the exact command sequence and final state without printing secrets.

## Verification Contracts

- `expose`: capture tunnel ID, public endpoint, and protocol-specific output; verify with `sealtun list --check` and `sealtun inspect <tunnel-id>`.
- `apply`: run or recommend `apply --dry-run` and `diff` first; after real apply, verify every intended tunnel with `list` and `inspect`.
- `domain add/set/clear`: verify with `domain status` or `domain verify`; for `add --wait`, report DNS/CNAME and certificate readiness separately.
- `share create/revoke`: verify with `share list`; never repeat a one-time share token unless it is the command's immediate output.
- `stop/start/cleanup`: verify with `list` or `inspect`; remember `stop` preserves entry resources while `cleanup` removes stopped, expired, stale, or error tunnel resources.
- `dashboard`: confirm local or remote bind address, token/basic-auth posture, live status, Resources tab, command previews, and whether write actions require page confirmation plus backend `confirm`.
- Troubleshooting: name the failing layer before proposing a mutation: local login/profile, local port, daemon/session, remote resource, DNS/certificate, access policy, or user protocol/auth.

## Operating Rules

- Do not expose user secrets in final answers, logs, commits, or generated docs. Prefer `*Env` fields and environment variables for passwords and tokens unless the user explicitly wants a one-shot inline example.
- Explain that Sealtun public access controls are enforced in the Sealtun server proxy layer, not by Ingress annotations. They protect HTTPS public business traffic, not the internal `/_sealtun/ws` control channel and not SSH/TCP direct NodePort traffic.
- For SSH exposure, prefer `sealtun expose 22 --protocol ssh` when the region supports public TCP NodePort. Use `sealtun ssh connect <tunnel-id>` only as a WebSocket ProxyCommand fallback.
- For generic TCP exposure, prefer `sealtun expose <port> --protocol tcp` and report the generated `<public-host>:<node-port>` endpoint.
- For declarative work, run or recommend `sealtun apply -f sealtun.yaml --dry-run` and `sealtun diff -f sealtun.yaml` before a real apply when feasible.
- For temporary share links, use `sealtun share create <tunnel-id> --ttl 1h --name review` only for HTTPS tunnels; tell users the URL is shown once because Sealtun stores only a token hash. Use `share list` for metadata and `share revoke` by name.
- For exporting config, use `sealtun export <tunnel-id>` or `sealtun export --all -o sealtun.yaml`. Explain that stored password/token hashes cannot be recovered; `--include-secret-placeholders` emits env var placeholders.
- For dashboard remote access, recommend `--basic-auth-user` plus `--basic-auth-password-env` with `--allow-remote`; `--open` is useful for local loopback dashboards. Dashboard live status uses a token-protected stream with polling fallback, and the Resources tab shows Kubernetes resource occupancy hints, not billing estimates.
- For first-time users, prioritize a clear path: install, `sealtun login`, `sealtun init`, confirm region/profile, then create or apply a tunnel. Mention that login stores credentials under `~/.sealtun` and that profiles are useful for multiple Sealos accounts, regions, or workspaces.
- Use exact command names and flags from the repository when modifying instructions. Supported tunnel protocols are `https`, dedicated `ssh`, and generic `tcp`; UDP/gRPC are not supported unless the repo adds them.

## Response Shape

For usage questions, give a short working command sequence and explain only the relevant gotchas. For troubleshooting, start with the lowest-cost local checks, then escalate to remote Kubernetes diagnostics.
